This is a toy OS. It consists of a boot loader, a 64-bit kernel, and two statically located
user programs. The kernel runs the two programs simultaneously, switching between them
using the PIT. There is a software interrupt at 30h.

Instructions (Mac OS X):

1) Download the latest nasm from http://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/
  Note that the nasm included with the Xcode command-line tools is quite old and will not
  build this project properly.

2) sudo port install qemu

3) make
